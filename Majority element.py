# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

# The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. 
# You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,2,3]
# Output: 3

# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2

# SOLUTION:

from math import *
from collections import *
from sys import *
from os import *

def findMajorityElement(arr, n):
	# Write your code here.
	for i in arr:
		if arr.count(i) > (n/2):
			return i
	return -1
